# Utility shell scripts

* docker_aliases.sh, git_aliases.sh

Aliases I use to speed up interactions with Docker and Git.

Usage:
#### **`~/.bash_profile`**
``` bash
. /bla/shell-scripts-git/docker_aliases.sh
. /bla/shell-scripts-git/git_aliases.sh
```

* media/

Organize your media collection by renaming photos and videos from
different cameras and phones to the date they were taken.

See

to learn how I use them.

* recover_canon/

Restore video stubs resulting from a sudden power loss during video filming on Canon cameras.

There's a README.md inside that folder, and
[a blog post about this script](https://www.shortn0tes.com/2019/03/restore-canon-videos.html)
as well.
